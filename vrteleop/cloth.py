"""Deformable garments (jeans) for the folding task.

The garment is a MuJoCo flex (dim=2, one body with 3 slide joints per vertex):
  * the flex provides bending stiffness (elastic2d="bend") and the rendered surface;
  * like woven fabric, the threads (warp along the leg, weft across) are inextensible
    (tendon equality constraints) while the bias diagonals are soft springs, so the
    cloth shears and drapes; air drag slows falling fabric;
  * contacts are handled by one small sphere geom per vertex. MuJoCo's native
    flex-geom collisions are capped at 50 contacts per (flex, body) pair and
    produce ~4 contacts per vertex, which is both wrong (a table only holds up
    50 vertices) and far too slow for real-time teleoperation. Vertex spheres give
    one contact per touching vertex, grip well between the 2F-85 pads, and also
    make the fabric collide with itself so folded layers stack instead of merging.

The flat pattern is a pair of jeans laid out front-side up. Coordinates in the
pattern are (u, v): u runs from the waistband (u=0) to the hems (u=length), v runs
across the garment (v<0 = the garment's right leg as it lies on the table).

class PinchGrasp:
    """Pinch grasp of fabric between the 2F-85 finger pads.

    Why a grasp model: the jaws close to a gap of a few millimetres, while the
    simulated fabric is resolved at ~4 cm. The fold of fabric that a real gripper
    squeezes between its pads cannot form on such a mesh, so friction alone never
    holds the cloth. This class adds exactly that missing piece, under the same
    conditions as a real pinch:

      * it triggers only while the jaws are *closing* (not when a closed gripper
        is pushed onto the cloth), once the jaws are nearly shut or stalled on fabric;
      * the fabric surface must be between the fingertips at that moment (the
        closest point on the cloth surface lies inside the jaw volume);
      * the pinched patch is held at the pose it had relative to the gripper, via soft
        `connect` equality constraints: the triangle under the fingertips *in every layer*
        between the pads (both panels of the jeans, or all layers of a folded stack), as
        real jaws squeeze everything between them. Holding only one layer would drag it
        through the others;
      * it slips out if the pull exceeds what a pinch can hold (`slip_force`),
        and is released as soon as the jaws open: once the pads are `release_gap`
        further apart than when they pinched, nothing squeezes the fabric any more
        (a small flick of the stick lets go, as with a real gripper).
    Everything else (contact with the table, the pads pushing fabric, the fabric
    colliding with itself, draping, bending) is ordinary MuJoCo physics.
